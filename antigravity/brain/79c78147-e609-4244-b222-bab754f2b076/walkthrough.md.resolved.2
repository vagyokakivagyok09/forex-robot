# Walkthrough - Persistent Signal History

I have refactored [app.py](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py) to implement a "Long-term Memory" using a JSON file (`trade_history.json`).

## Changes

### 1. JSON Persistence Helper Functions
Added [load_history](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py#27-36) and [save_history](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py#37-44) to manage the JSON file.

```python
HISTORY_FILE = "trade_history.json"

def load_history():
    # ... loads from json file ...

def save_history(history):
    # ... saves to json file ...
```

### 2. Initialization from File
Instead of initializing an empty dictionary in `st.session_state`, the app now loads the history from the file at the start of [main()](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py#177-426).

```python
    # Memória inicializálása (Fájlból)
    daily_signals = load_history()
```

### 3. Saving Signals
When a Telegram message is sent, the signal is saved to the dictionary and immediately written to the JSON file.

```python
                if send_telegram(msg):
                    # Siker esetén mentés a fájlba
                    daily_signals[symbol] = {
                        'date': today_str, 
                        'direction': analysis['signal_type']
                    }
                    save_history(daily_signals)
```

## Verification
I have verified that the code implements the logic as described. The bot will now check `trade_history.json` to see if a signal was already sent for the day, preventing duplicate alerts even if the server is restarted.
