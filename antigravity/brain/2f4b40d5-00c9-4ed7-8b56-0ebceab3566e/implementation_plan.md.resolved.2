# London Breakout Strategy Implementation Plan

## Goal
Add a "London Breakout" mode to the app that visualizes the Asian session range and suggests breakout trades for intraday timeframes.

## Proposed Changes
### UI Updates
#### [MODIFY] [app.py](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py)
- Add a checkbox `🇬🇧 London Breakout Nézet` in the sidebar.
- Only enable/show this if the timeframe is '1h' or '15m'.

### Core Logic
- **Asian Range Calculation**:
    - Filter data for the *current day* (last available day in data).
    - Select candles between 00:00 and 08:00.
    - Calculate `Max High` and `Min Low` of this period.
    - Calculate `Range = Max High - Min Low`.

### Visualization
- **Asian Box**: Draw a light blue rectangle (`shape`) on the chart covering the 00:00-08:00 period and the High-Low range.
- **Entry Levels**:
    - Green Dashed Line at `Max High` (Long Entry).
    - Red Dashed Line at `Min Low` (Short Entry).
- **Target Levels**:
    - Green Solid Line at `Max High + Range` (Long Target).
    - Red Solid Line at `Min Low - Range` (Short Target).

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Select '15m' or '1h' timeframe.
- Toggle "London Breakout Nézet".
- Verify a blue box appears for the 00:00-08:00 period of the current day.
- Check if the lines (Entry/Target) are calculated correctly relative to the box.
- Ensure it doesn't crash on '1d' timeframe (should be disabled or hidden).
