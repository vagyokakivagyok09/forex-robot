# Strict London Breakout Implementation Plan

## Goal
Refactor the app to focus exclusively on the London Breakout strategy, removing historical pattern matching and providing clear, single-direction signals based on the Asian session range.

## Proposed Changes
### Core Logic ([app.py](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py))
#### [MODIFY] [app.py](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py)
- **Remove**: [find_top_patterns](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py#77-129) function and related calls.
- **Add**: Logic to identify the current day's Asian Session (00:00-08:00).
- **Add**: Breakout detection:
    - `Long`: Current Price > Asian High
    - `Short`: Current Price < Asian Low
    - `Neutral`: Price inside range.

### Visualization
- **Asian Box**: Draw a semi-transparent rectangle for the 00:00-08:00 range.
- **Projection**:
    - If `Long`: Draw a **GREEN dashed line** from Current Price to (Asian High + Box Height).
    - If `Short`: Draw a **RED dashed line** from Current Price to (Asian Low - Box Height).
    - If `Neutral`: Draw nothing.

### Alerts
- Update Telegram logic to send alerts ONLY when a breakout is detected (Price outside box).
- Target Price = Box Projection.
- Stop Loss = Opposite side of the box (or mid-point for tighter risk).

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Check the chart for the Asian Box.
- Verify that ONLY one line appears (Green or Red) if price is outside the box.
- Verify no lines appear if price is inside the box.
- Check Telegram alert content matches the breakout logic.
