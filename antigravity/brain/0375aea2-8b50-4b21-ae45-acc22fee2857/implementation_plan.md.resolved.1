# Implementation Plan - Sports Betting Decision Support App

## Goal Description
Create a premium-looking, personal web application to assist in sports betting decisions. The app will provide mathematical tools to calculate stakes, probabilities, and expected value, as well as a simple tracker to log betting history. It will run locally in the browser using `localStorage` for data persistence.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Persistence**: The app will use `localStorage` (browser memory). If you clear your browser cache, your saved bet history will be lost. For a personal tool, this is usually acceptable, but let me know if you need a file export feature later.

## Proposed Changes

### Core Architecture
- **Tech Stack**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript, Vanilla CSS.
- **Design**: Modern Dark Mode, Glassmorphism, "Premium" feel (Gradients, Inter/Outfit font).
- **Structure**: Single Page Application (SPA) feel using simple tab/section switching.

### Features

#### 1. Dashboard (Home)
- Quick summary of tracked bets (ROI, Win Rate, Profit/Loss).
- Navigation to tools.

#### 2. Calculators & Data
- **Odds Converter**: Convert between Decimal (EU), Fractional (UK), and American (US) odds. Show Implied Probability (%).
- **[PENDING] Data Integration**: Fetch/Scrape data from user-provided website (Requires feasibility check).

#### 3. Bet Tracker
- **Add Bet Form**: Date, Sport, Event, Selection, Odds, Stake, Result (Pending/Win/Loss).
- **History List**: Scrollable list of past bets.
- **Stats Engine**: Calculates the metrics shown on the Dashboard.

### File Structure
#### [NEW] index.html
- Main entry point. Contains the skeleton and container for dynamic content.

#### [NEW] css/style.css
- All styles. CSS Variables for colors/spacing. Flexbox/Grid for layout. Animations.

#### [NEW] js/app.js
- Main logic. State management (current tab). Event listeners.

#### [NEW] js/calculators.js
- Math logic for conversions.

#### [NEW] js/data_fetcher.js
- Logic for handling external data (TBD based on site).

#### [NEW] js/storage.js
- Wrapper for `localStorage` operations (saveBet, getBets, deleteBet).

#### [NEW] js/ui.js
- DOM manipulation functions to render the different views.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A (Manual verification for this scope).

### Manual Verification
- **Calculators**: Compare results with known online calculators (e.g., if Odds=2.0, Prob=50%, EV should be 0).
- **Tracker**: Add a bet, refresh page, ensure bet is still there. Delete a bet, ensure it's gone.
- **UI**: Check responsiveness on mobile/desktop view. Verify "Premium" look and feel.
