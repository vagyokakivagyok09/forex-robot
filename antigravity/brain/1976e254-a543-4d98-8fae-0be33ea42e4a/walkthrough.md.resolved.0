# Walkthrough - Trading Plan Analysis

I have added a new section to the Forex Pattern Matching app to provide actionable trading insights.

## Changes

### [app.py](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py)

#### [MODIFY] [app.py](file:///c:/Users/Tomi/.gemini/app.py)
-   Added a "Trading Plan Analysis" section below the chart.
-   Implemented logic to calculate:
    -   **Trend**: Based on the average projection end price vs current price.
    -   **Stop Loss**: Calculated using a 1:2 Risk/Reward ratio.
    -   **Probability**: Percentage of top matches agreeing with the trend direction.
-   Added a 3-column UI to display these metrics with appropriate styling (Green for Long, Red for Short).

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
-   The app should now display a "Kereskedési Terv Elemzés" section after running an analysis.
-   The metrics should dynamically update based on the selected ticker and timeframe.
-   The "Irány" should show LONG 🟢 or SHORT 🔴 with the correct color.
-   The "Szintek" column should show the calculated Entry, Target, and Stop Loss prices.
